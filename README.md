# Advent of Code 2023

Each day has its binary. Run with `$ cargo run --bin day1`.

## Principles

- All examples and real input files are tested to allow algorithm re-work. Run
  with `cargo test`. 
- Errors are not handled, so expect a lot of `unwrap()`. 
- The coding style is not fixed. It's sometimes more functional, sometimes more
imperative.
